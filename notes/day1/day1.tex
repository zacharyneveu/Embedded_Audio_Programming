\title{ Intro }

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\subsection*{Intro}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Platform: \ac{BBB} w/ audio hat
	\item Start in PD, delve into C++ eventually, even a little assembly!
	\item Introduce some hardware components as well - pots, caps, etc.
	\item Project: design an audio interactive app
	\item No tests, grade based on participation, assignments, and final project proposal/demo
	\item Make sure to cite any example code used, and describe what our personal contribution is
	\item Don't skip more than 2 classes or grade drop
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Embedded Systems}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Really good at some tasks, less good at others
	\item Going to focus on \acp{SBC}
	\item Most \acp{SBC} have an audio interface
	\item Benefits to \ac{SBC}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Less processes competing for resources/fewer interrupts
		\item Can guarantee realtime requirements (if using realtime OS)
		\item Lower latency because smaller buffer possible
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Latency}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Audio Latency: buffer size in samples
	\item Control Latency: latency of input plus audio latency
	\item Controls typically parsed in a loop with fixed frequency
	\item Adds additional latency that is variable...
	\item Control parsing and audio buffer not necessarily integer multiples
	\item Must wait for both to complete to get signal through, so quite variable latency
	\item Variable latency $\to$ jitter (super annoying)
	\item USB period parsing ~5 ms (pretty big)
	\item Problem: timbre strongly effected by jitter even < 1ms
	\item \ac{SBC} can remove all jitter! \ac{ADC} runs way closer to audio sample rate.
	\item Bela w/ buffer size of 16 - fixed control latency of 0.35ms
	\item MIDI latency much worse - $2.85\pm 2.5ms$
\end{itemize}
