Embedded Audio Programming MUST 3540
====================================

Time: Mon and Thurs, 11:45am-1:25pm Location: Ryder 233 Instructor:
Victor Zappi -- <v.zappi@northeastern.edu> Office: Ryder 357 Office
Hours: Tue and Fri, 3-4pm (or any other available time/day by
appointment)

Course Description
==================

This course proposes to explore embedded computers and their employment
for the design of interactive audio applications. The main objective of
the course is to teach how to program audio applications that takes
advantage from the unique features of these systems; this will be
accomplished by transferring the coding skills acquired so far on
general purpose computers to the languages and the programming
rationales of embedded hardware. The classes will primarily cover
low-latency real-time audio synthesis/processing, yet students will go
through an in-depth introduction to physical computing, sensors and
simple electronics. The final project will provide students with a
concrete opportunity to gain experience with the full design
development-test cycle of software and hardware interactive audio
technologies.

Learning Outcomes
=================

By the end of the course, students should be able to: • discuss the
features and the limits of both embedded systems and general purpose
computers; • analyze the requirements of a target audio application,
relate them to human physiology and choose the

most appropriate technology for its design;

-   combine creativity and computational thinking in the design of
    responsive audio applications;
-   design simple custom electronics and interface it with embedded
    audio software;
-   transfer high-level programming skills to the specific context of
    low-latency embedded systems (using Pure Data);
-   develop high-performance digital signal processing and interactive
    applications in C++;
-   leverage optimization techniques and lateral thinking to deal with
    limited computational resources (using Assembly) and physical
    constraints;
-   prototype self-contained, highly responsive musical instruments and
    interactive audio installations/devices.

Required/suggested Material
===========================

There is no required text book for the course. Yet, the topics presented
throughout the classes are covered in the following books:

Kuo, Sen M., Bob H. Lee, and Wenshun Tian (2013). Real-time digital
signal processing: fundamentals, implementations and applications. John
Wiley & Sons, 2013. ISBN: 978-1-118 41432-3

Molloy, Derek (2019). Exploring BeagleBone: Tools and Techniques for
Building with Embedded Linux, 2nd Edition. Wiley. ISBN:
978-1-119-53316-0

You must have your own laptop(+headphones), with installed Pure Data,
which is a free, cross-platform, open-source software. You will borrow a
kit from the Department, composed of a Beaglebone Black embedded
computer, a Bela cape and a set of electronic components and sensors.
The complete kit shall be returned after the final project presentation
(Proto Fest).

Some of the assignments as well as the final project may require you to
purchase some affordable equipment/ material, including additional
electronic components, sensors, actuators.

Evaluation
==========

Your final grade will be based on the following:

5.  Attendance and participation (including TRACE Course Evaluation)
6.  Assignment 1 on high-level audio programming (fixed)
7.  Assignment 2 on high-level audio programming (open-ended)
8.  Assignment 3 on embedded digital signal processing (fixed)
9.  Final project proposal
10. Final project demo at Proto Fest

Assignments
===========

Assignment 1 will consist of developing a Pure Data patch that runs on
Bela and fulfills a set of simple structural, synthesis and control
constraints as imposed by the instructor.

Assignment 2 will be an open-ended small project; you will be asked to
design and develop a more advanced synthesis/processing Pure Data patch
and interface it with simple custom circuitry (sensors and/or
actuators). Assignment 3 will consist of recreating a real-time digital
signal processing application on Bela using C++; the application will be
chosen by the instructor.

Final Project, demo (Proto Fest) and proposal
=============================================

For the final project, you will have to design and develop a real-time
audio application (e.g., musical instrument, effect processor, audio
installation) that capitalizes on the specific features of embedded
audio technologies. You will submit your code and present the project as
part of a small Interactive Media exhibition, called Proto Fest, open to
all CAMD students, faculty and staff. During the event, the instructor
will request a formally evaluated demo of the project, in the form of:

-   an interactive showcase of the device's functionalities;
-   an analysis of its inner workings;
-   a discussion of the extent to which it leverages the embedded audio
    architecture.

Slides and other additional material are not requested, but feel free to
organize the demo as you prefer.

A 2-3 page project proposal will have to be submitted around a month
before Proto Fest. It will have to include the details of the device
design (what it does and how), a list of required materials and a
development plan (how hardware and software development is scheduled).
You are encouraged to include pictures, sketches, code snippets and any
other material that may help describe the device and the underlying
technologies.

The day of the proposal submission, I will meet each of you in class for
a short private meeting (Project Kick-off Mentoring), to help you set
off the development of the project (e.g., material gathering and
scheduling advice). Two of the following classes will be dedicated to
the development of your projects, in the fashion of workshops during
which you will get additional advice from me and from your peers.

Academic Integrity
==================

Plagiarism will result in a 0 grade. The code you submit for your
assignments and final project will be scanned by an automatic plagiarism
checker, and I will personally check the authenticity of the design of
your final project. There will be no make-ups in case of plagiarism.

TRACE Course Evaluation
=======================

The College of Arts, Media and Design considers student feedback
essential and requires all students to complete TRACE evaluations at the
end of the semester. You will be asked to provide a screen shot to your
instructor that reflects your participation. Note that you can,
anonymously, opt out of completing the survey and still obtain the
screen shot that satisfies the TRACE requirement. The TRACE evaluations
will be included in the Attendance and Participation portion of the
final grade for the course.

Prerequisites
=============

To enroll, you must have taken MUST 2341--Computer Music Fundamentals.
Other courses on general purpose programming and Physical Computing
(e.g., ARTG 2260, ARTG 3250, EECE 2150, EECE 2160, EECE 2300, EECE 2560)
may be accepted as prerequisites, but this is at the discretion of the
instructor.

Absence policy
==============

MUST 3540 follows a similar policy as the music theory courses at
Northeastern. Two absences (for 100 minute classes) are allowed. On the
third absence and each thereafter, you'll be assessed a 5% deduction for
each absence.

Respect and Interpersonal Communication
=======================================

The instructor encourages you all to join Northeastern's commitment to
create a friendly, respectful and inclusive environment, inside and
outside the class. Critical thinking and constructive discussion will be
fostered and positively evaluated, while any kind of discrimination and
harassment will not be permitted. In case you feel the need for special
accommodations, because of disabilities, emergencies or any other
situation that may affect your learning experience, please contact the
instructor as soon as possible. We will discuss appropriate solutions
that might be helpful to you. Timeliness is extremely important though!
Just contact me, even if you are unsure about the impact of the problem.
The more you wait the less I can/will do.
